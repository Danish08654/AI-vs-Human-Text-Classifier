 Project Intro:
The goal of this project was to create a smart plagiarism checker that goes beyond simple text matching.Traditional tools fail when text is
paraphrased or AI-generated so I built a solution that understands meaning, context, and semantic similarity, not just exact words.

How It Works:

1)Preprocessed text for tokenization & cleaning
 2) Generated embeddings using transformer-based models
 3) Calculated semantic similarity between documents
 4) Integrated AI-generated content detection
 5) Built a fast comparison pipeline for large datasets
 6) Produced detailed similarity scores + highlighted matched areas

The system can detect:
 1) Exact matches
 2) Paraphrased content
 3) AI-generated content
 4) Cross-document similarity

 Results:
1)High accuracy in plagiarism and paraphrasing detection
 2) Robust against AI-generated rewriting
 3) Fast comparison even for long documents
 4 Detailed similarity report + highlighted suspicious segments
The final system performs significantly better than simple keyword-based plagiarism tools.

Skills / Tools Used:

1) Python
 2) Transformers / BERT / Sentence-BERT
 3) Scikit-learn
 4) Text Embeddings
 5) NLP Preprocessing
 6) Semantic Similarity
 7 FastAPI (API deployment)
